Data Engineering Platforms Project: Affordable Housing Development

Project Objectives:
This project seeks to develop an end-to-end data pipeline for affordable housing data to:
Examine data between the location, price, and size of affordable housing developments and standard-of-life features available for tenants.

Foster a better understanding of:
	Factors that affect location, prices, amenities, and quality of affordable housing developments.
	
	The distribution of socio-economic indicators, economic activity, access to transit and parks, in each neighborhood.

	Potentially identify correlations that may confirm or deny the team’s initial hypotheses related to affordable housing. 

Business Use Case:

Understanding affordable housing development’s characteristics’ relationship to socio-economic features could be used to develop more conscious policies and drive significant investments that provide inhabitants of affordable housing a better quality of life (i.e. development of additional public transportation in isolated neighborhoods, investment in local businesses, etc.)

Executive Summary:
	Affordable housing developments aid cities in promoting diversity and inclusion, improving quality of life, enriching neighborhoods, and growing the local economy. In this study, we investigate whether the locations of affordable housing developments provide positive features for its population, relating to accessibility to public transportation, amenities, active commercial scene, walkability, and general neighborhood activity.
	
	Through our investigations, we discovered stark discrepancies between neighborhoods with a multitude of affordable housing developments and those without. Generally, areas with scarce access to transit and worse socio economic performance contain the majority of affordable housing developments.
	
Conclusion:
Through the course of the project we discovered strong correlations between the count of affordable housing developments per neighborhood and:
	
	Socioeconomic status of neighborhood, which could perhaps be explained by higher land costs for more affluent neighborhoods

	Transit scores of neighborhood for L trains, which could perhaps further isolate neighborhoods with lower household income per capita.

Additionally, weaker correlations were identified between the count of affordable housing developments per neighborhood and:

	Business density of each neighborhood

	Count of abandoned buildings of each neighborhood

It is difficult to draw conclusions from these weaker correlations.
